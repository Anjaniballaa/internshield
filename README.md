## **What Is InternShield?**

InternShield is a **full-stack, AI-powered deployment safety gate** that hooks into your GitHub repositories and automatically audits every push and pull request — before any of it reaches your production server.

It scans for hardcoded secrets, vulnerable dependencies, debug artifacts, and risky patterns. Then it uses **Groq's LLaMA** to explain every finding in plain English and suggest an exact fix. If the risk score is too high, the deployment is **blocked at the commit level** — automatically.

> *No more "oops I pushed my API key." No more "I forgot to remove console.log(password)."*

## **CI/CD Is the Core Idea Here**

> This project was built to demonstrate a real understanding of what CI/CD actually means — not just "push code and it deploys," but the practice of **catching problems automatically, at every stage of the pipeline, before they become production incidents.**

**The pipeline I implemented follows the exact shape of a real CI/CD flow:**

## **Feature Overview**

<br/>

### 🔐 Static Code Scanner

Five categories of checks run on every changed file:

| Check | What It Catches |
|---|---|
| **Hardcoded Secrets** | API keys, tokens, passwords embedded in source code using regex pattern matching |
| **Missing Env Variables** | `process.env.X` calls where `X` is not defined in the `.env` file |
| **Debug Mode** | `DEBUG=true`, `morgan()` left on, `debugger;` statements in production config |
| **Sensitive Console Logs** | `console.log(password)`, `console.log(token)` — data that shouldn't be logged |
| **TODO Comments** | `// TODO`, `// FIXME`, `// HACK` left in production code |

<br/>

### 📦 Dependency Vulnerability Scanner

Reads `package.json` from the pushed code, calls the **npm audit API**, and flags:
- Critical severity packages (+20 pts each)
- High severity packages (+10 pts each)
- Medium severity packages (+5 pts each)

<br/>

### 🤖 Groq AI Explanation Engine

Every finding gets sent to **Groq's LLaMA** (ultra-fast inference) with a structured prompt requesting JSON output:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "explanation": "Plain English explanation of what the problem is",
      "fix": "Exact, actionable fix suggestion with code example"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Overall security posture summary"
}
```

No vague warnings. Every issue comes with a specific fix.

<br/>

### 📊 Risk Scoring Engine

```
Hardcoded Secret      → +35 pts
Missing .env Variable → +25 pts
Critical Dependency   → +20 pts
Debug Mode            → +15 pts
High Dependency       → +10 pts
Sensitive console.log → +10 pts
Medium Dependency     →  +5 pts
TODO Comment          →  +5 pts

────────────────────────────────
0 – 30   →  ✅  Low Risk    → Deploy allowed
31 – 60  →  ⚠️  Medium Risk → Deploy allowed (warning posted)
61+      →  ❌  High Risk   → Deploy BLOCKED + email sent
```

<br/>

### 💬 GitHub PR Comment

After every scan, InternShield posts a formatted Markdown comment directly on the PR or commit — including the risk score, every finding with its GPT explanation, and the suggested fix. The developer sees exactly what's wrong and how to fix it without leaving GitHub.

<br/>

### ✅ GitHub Commit Status

Uses the **GitHub Statuses API** to set the commit state:
- `High Risk` → `state: failure` → **merge button is greyed out**
- `Low / Medium` → `state: success` → merge is allowed

This integrates directly with GitHub branch protection rules.

## **Future Contributions**

This project is open for ideas, improvements, and extensions. A few directions worth exploring:

| Idea | Description |
|---|---|
| **Multi-language support** | Extend the static scanner beyond JS/TS to cover Python, Go, and Java codebases — each with their own secret patterns, debug idioms, and env-var conventions |
| **Custom rule engine** | Let teams define their own scan rules via a config file (`.internshield.yml`) checked into the repo — so org-specific patterns and banned imports can be enforced automatically |
| **Slack / Discord alerts** | Push scan results to a team channel the moment a scan completes, so the whole team is aware of blocked deployments without checking email |

Pull requests are welcome. If you're adding a new scanner check or integration, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
